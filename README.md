# Single-Vessel-Model

This file calculates the Pressure and Diameter relations between the Diameter of the large arteriole and the Pressure at the midpoint of the large arteriole. This file can be modified by a simple way to calculate the perfusion on the vessel. The perfusion_norm term relates the normalised perfusion. Thus to run Normalised perfusion please run the perfusion_norm vs Pressure_in on the last line which says to plot. In that case the figures described in the latex document can be replicated. 

Files Required : DAnometa2vals.mat, Carlson(2008)_dataP.csv, perfusion(passive).csv for Carlson_Passive.py...DAnometa2vals.mat, Carlson(2008)_data.csv, perfusion(myo).csv for the Carlson_Passive_myo.py Carlson_2008(myo+meta+shear).csv and perfusion(myo+shear+meta).csv for the Carlson_metabolic.py
Carlson(Passive).py generates the perfusion and Pressure_Diameter curves for the passive case, Carlson_Passive_myo.py generates the perfusion and Pressure_Diameter curves for the myogenic case, The Carlson_metabolic.py generates the perfusion and Pressure_Diameter curves for the metabolic case...
Libraries Required : Scipy Numpy 

The libraries can be installed by pip install numpy or scipy or if used in Ananconda then conda install ... 

Instructions. To generate all curves just run the code.. Except in the second code the particular pressue diameter curve aligned with the one in the paper can be generated by commenting out line (shear = 5.5) as instructed in the python file...
